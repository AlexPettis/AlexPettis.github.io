## Database

This database is a collection of items, each with specific features and prices. It includes details like the item name, a description of its characteristics (such as whether it's gluten-free, kosher, or vegan), and its price. You can search for items by name, filter them based on their price range, or select specific features that youâ€™re interested in. The database is designed to help you easily find and compare different items based on what matters most to you.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results ='asis'}

#shiny::runApp("Searchable_database/app.R")
