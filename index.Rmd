Hello, my name is Alex Pettis, and I recently graduated from Appalachian State University in Summer 2024 with dual Masterâ€™s degrees in Applied Data Analytics and Business Administration. For my undergraduate degree, I pursued Mathematics with a concentration in General Mathematics, along with minors in Computer Science and Statistics, and a certificate in Sports Analytics.

I am actively seeking roles as a Data Analyst, with a particular focus on finance, sports, health care, or supply chain industries.

I have created this website to showcase my coursework, research, and professional experience. Additionally, it contains my current resume and links to download software relevant to the courses.


This website was last rendered on `r format(Sys.time(), "%A, %B %d, %Y - %X.")`

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('<p>This site has been viewed <span id="site-views"></span> times.</p>
<script>
// Check if the user has already been counted in this session
if (!localStorage.getItem("site-visit-counted")) {
    // Increment the global view counter
    fetch("https://api.countapi.xyz/hit/yourdomain.com/global-counter")
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        document.getElementById("site-views").innerText = data.value;
        
        // Mark that the user has been counted in localStorage
        localStorage.setItem("site-visit-counted", "true");
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error("Error fetching view count:", error);
    });
} else {
    // Just retrieve the current view count without incrementing it
    fetch("https://api.countapi.xyz/get/yourdomain.com/global-counter")
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        document.getElementById("site-views").innerText = data.value;
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error("Error fetching view count:", error);
    });
}
</script>')
