Hello, my name is Alex Pettis, and I recently graduated from Appalachian State University in Summer 2024 with dual Masterâ€™s degrees in Applied Data Analytics and Business Administration. For my undergraduate degree, I pursued Mathematics with a concentration in General Mathematics, along with minors in Computer Science and Statistics, and a certificate in Sports Analytics.

I am actively seeking roles as a Data Analyst, with a particular focus on finance, sports, health care, or supply chain industries.

I have created this website to showcase my coursework, research, and professional experience. Additionally, it contains my current resume and links to download software relevant to the courses.
