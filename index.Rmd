Hello, my name is Alex Pettis and I am currently a graduate student at Appalachian State University, set to graduate in Summer 2024 with a Master of Science in Applied Data Analytics - Interdisciplinary Analytics Concentration, MS and Business Administration - Interdisciplinary Business Concentration, MBA For my undergraduate degree, I pursued Mathematics with a concentration in General Mathematics as well as minors in Computer Science and Statistics, and a certificate in Sports Analytics. 

My career goal is to become a Data Analyst with a particular focus on either finance, sports, health care, or supply chain industries.

I have created this website to showcase my coursework, research, and professional experience. Additionally, it contains my current resume and links to download software relevant to the courses.
