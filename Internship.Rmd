## Course Description

This was an analytics internship for the Sports Analytics Certificate using NCAA baseball data from 2019-2022 seasons. The coaches of the Appalachian State University baseball team wanted a 2-d distribution map of where flyballs were. Then I needed to grab the outfield balls. We donâ€™t want the shallow fly balls. Once the correct hit balls were found, then it was a matter of creating a 2- D distribution map of where they happened. Lastly, I need to separate the handedness of the pitcher and batter more formally known as the platoon split.
