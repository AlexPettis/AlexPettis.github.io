Here is some python code for differential equations. The first python code is an example to use as a reference when completing the rest. 

## Example

[Example Code](A6/Example.py)

## Directions

Your job:  

Rumor Spread: This program assumes all necessary information is contained within the function, so there are no arguments to specify.

1) initialize the values of k and Rumor

2) determine the appropriate arguments for the range function.

3) determine the update formula for calculating the new value of R.

4) create the function call and run the program.


Coffee Cooling: This program is designed to allow you to run it with different values of k and dt, hence values for those two variables will be the required arguments for the function.

1) initialize the values of t, T, and n (remember that n must be integer!)

2) enter the update values for t and T

3) create the function call and run the program for the values of k and dt requested.
