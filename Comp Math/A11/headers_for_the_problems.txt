Problem 7:

def stat_calc(A):
# takes a list, A, as input
# prints out the mean, standard
# deviation, and variance
  n = len(A)


Problem 8:

def atan_calc(x,n)
# uses a procedure involving
# elliptical functions to find
# the value of arctan(x)
# to n bit precision for x in (0,1)


Problem 9:

def int_calc(a,b):
# prints the symbolic solution to
# the integral from 1 to a of the
# function x^b.


Problem 10

def m_v_mult(A,v):
# Performs matrix-vector multiplication
# with an mxn matrix A (stored as rows) 
# and an n element vector v

  m = len(A)
  n = len(A[0])
